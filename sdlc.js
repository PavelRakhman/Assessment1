    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


/*MY ANSWERS:

Stage 1 Planning
Stage 2 Analysis of Requirements
Stage 3 Design
Stage 4 Implementation
Stage 5 Testing & Integration
Stage 6 Maintain

/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = `

This is the second stage at which the team gather prepares and analyzes a list of the customer's expectations for the software product, as well 
as a list of business needs that the software product is expected to address. Usually, 
this list of requirements is based on the information that the business analysts gather from the clients or stock holders. The result of this work
is documented and submitted for approval before the team moves on tot the next phase--design, that is.   
 `
const Design =`Design is the third stage of the software development lifecycle. At this stage,
 the team determine what programming languages and tools to use for the development, how the software product will look and interact with the user(s), and what platforms it will be supported by.`
const Implementation =`At this stage, a team of developers (or sometimes an individual developer) create the end
 product using the programming language(s) and tools selected during the previous stages.`

 const TestingAndIntegration = `It is extremely rare that a commercial application is developed as one block of code; usually, 
 the project is broken down into a number of modules each of which is assigned to one group or several groups of coders. Before the end-product is deployed, it is tested
 for functionality and compatibility. This is done to make sure that each module correctly interacts with others,
 as well as to eliminate errors and glitches during interaction with the target user(s). Once the application has been tested, it
 is made available to the client or the target audience.`
const Maintain = "In the last phase of the software development life cycle--that is, maintenance, the product is continuously monitored, upgraded and repaired."
